This file includes 4,829 observations and 12 variables. 

Each observation corresponds to a measurement on a single child. The data are in long format, sorted by antigen, childid, time.  

All of the IgG antibody responses are in units of median florescence intensity minus background (MFI-bg) and were measured in a multiplex bead assay on the Luminex platform.  For details about the study design and measurement methods, please refer to these related articles:
