# enterics-seroepi/R/ subdirectory README

This directory includes computational notebooks that completed all analyses in the article entitled _Enteropathogen antibody dynamics and force of infection among children in low-resource settings_. 

The R script `enterics-seroepi-run-all.R` runs the notebooks in order and will re-create the entire analysis. Before running the notbooks, you will need to create directories entitled `output` and `figs` one level up, alongside the `data` directory, to store saved results (not pushed to GitHub).
