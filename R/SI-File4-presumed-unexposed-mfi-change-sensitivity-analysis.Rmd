# Notebook summary

### Identifying presumed seroconverters
One approach to identifying a seropositivity cutoff in a longitudinal study is to identify children who presumably seroconvert from negative to positive based on a change in their antibody levels, and then use the distribution of their antibody levels before seroconversion to identify a seropositivity cutoff.  The rationale for this two-step process that estimates a cutoff (and does not simply classify children as seroconverers versus not) is that the cutoff can then be applied to identify children who were seropositive but did not actually seroconvert during the study. This was common for antibody response to enteric pathogens in the study cohorts, where exposure ocurred frequently and very early in life.

### Level of increase in antibody levels to identify seroconversion
The method relies on choosing the appropriate magnitude of change in antibody levels used identify presumed seroconverters, which is generally unknown.  Most immunogenicity abnd pathogen challenge studies have used a 4-fold increase. In this study, we used an increase of +2 or more on the log$_{10}$ scale, equal to a 100-fold increase, to identify presumed seroconverters. Although this was likely a conservative assumption, it still led to high levels of agreement with other classification approachs (generally >95%) when applied across cohorts and antibodies.

### Sensitivity analysis description 

Here, we conduct a sensitivity analysis that searches over a range of increases in antibody levels used to identify "presumed seroconverters". For each increase, we then calculated the mean and SD of the distribution before the change, and used that as a seropositivity cutoff. We then compared the classification accuracy of each value against classifications based on cutoffs derived from ROC-curves or mixture models, as available.

In the present study, we used two additional methods to determine seropositivity cutoffs:

   * For _Giardia_ (VSP-3, VSP-5), _Cryptosporidium_ (Cp17, Cp23), and _E. histolytica_ (LecA) antigens, known negative and positive samples were used to identify an optimal cutoff based on a receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve.  
   * For all other pathogens, we fit a 2-component, finite Gaussian mixture model to the antibody distributions, and then used the lower component's mean plus 3 standard deviations to define a cutoff value. This identified reasonable cutoff values for many, but not all, additional antibodies. In some cases the mixture model based approach did not identify reasonable cutoff values (i.e., near or above the upper limit assay's dynamic range).

Given this other classification information, we compared a range of changes in antibody levels used to identify children who presumably seroconverted in terms of agreement with ROC-based and mixture model-based classification of seropositivity.  

We searched over a range of changes from +0.3 to +2.5 on the log10 MFI-bg scale (this corresponds to a 10^0.3 = 2-fold to 10^2.5 = 316-fold increase in antibody levels). For each change in antibody levels (0.3 to 2.5), we identified the children who would be identified as seroconverters.  From these children, we then estimated the mean plus 3 standard deviations of their antibody levels at their first measurement, when they were presumably unexposed. This is the seropositivity cutoff among the "presumed unexposed".  We then estimated agreement and Cohen's Kappa statistics for each change and identify the magnitude of change that corresponded with the maximum level of agreement.

### Sensitivity analysis results

The optimal change in MFI levels used to identify presumed seroconverters varied by cohort and antigen, where "optimal" was defined as the minimum change in MFI with maximum agreement with respect to ROC-based or mixture model-based seropositivity classifications. 

For antigens with both ROC-based cutoffs and mixture model-based cutoffs, results were similar between the two comparisons. This result reflects good agreement between ROC- and mixture model-based cutoffs (detailed results in this article's Supplementary Information File 2). 

Over the range of values considered, the method led to cutoff values with classification agreement that was very high compared with both ROC- and mixture model-based classifications. In Haiti, optimal agreement exceeded 0.92 for all comparisons. In Kenya, optimal agreement exceeded 0.98 for all comparisons.

In Haiti, the change in MFI values that led to highest agreement were generally $\geq 2$ on the log$_{10}$ scale. In Kenya, change values were lower and generally in the range of 0.5 to 1.5.  In general, across both countries, there was not a large decline in agreement at higher change values imposed to identify presumed seroconverters when developing a cutoff (an exception was _Cryptosporidium_ Cp23 in Kenya). 

Taken together, this sensitivity analysis supports the use of an increase of +2 log$_{10}$ MFI to identify presumed seroconverters in the definition of seropositivity cutoffs for antigens considered.

The bottom panel plots the estimated seropositivity cutoff as a function of change in MFI levels used to identify presumed seroconverters. The mean plus 3 SDs of the distribution of antibody levels before presumed seroconversion was used to estimate the cutoff. For a given cutoff, the middle and top panels summarize classification agreement with the ROC-based seropositiity cutoff based on Cohen's Kappa (middle) and proportion agreement (top).

Labeled dashed lines indicate the minimum magnitude of change in antibody levels that led to highest agreement, along with the corresponding seropositivity cutoff values, Cohen's Kappa, and agreement.

### Figure to summarize results

The bottom panel plots the estimated seropositivity cutoff as a function of change in MFI levels used to identify presumed seroconverters. The mean plus 3 SDs of the distribution of antibody levels before presumed seroconversion was used to estimate the cutoff. For a given cutoff, the middle and top panels summarize classification agreement with the mixture model-based seropositiity cutoff based on Cohen's Kappa (middle) and proportion agreement (top).

Labeled dashed lines indicate the minimum magnitude of change in antibody levels that led to highest agreement, along with the corresponding seropositivity cutoff values, Cohen's Kappa, and agreement.
