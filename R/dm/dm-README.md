# enterics-seroepi/R/dm subdirectory README

Note: this subdirectory includes scripts that create the publicly available datasets stored in the `enterics-seroepi/data` subdirectory. You will not be able to run them because you do not have access to the underlying, raw data. They are provided for completeness / posterity.
